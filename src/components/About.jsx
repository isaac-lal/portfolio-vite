              I was always fascinated with websites ever since I was a kid
              watching videos on youtube.com, searching things up on google.com,
              playing games on multiple websites, and more. I loved how
              technology made the ideas of websites come to life, but I never
              really understood how it was made. I knew I wanted to be a part of
              the process for years, but I really haven't gotten my head engaged
              in it until August 2022.{' '}

              With the goal of creating my own professional website, I had
              decided to learn about{' '}
              <span className='text-[#00bfff]'>HTML and CSS</span> to start.
              These two technologies helped me to create a very basic website
              with limited functionality, but still looked decent. After that, I
              have devoted most of my time in mastering{' '}
              <span className='text-[#00bfff]'>JavaScript</span> and concepts
              like if-statements, for-loops, logic, and transitioning into
              learning about Data Structures & Algorithms, along with the
              Document Object Model (DOM). After JavaScript was done, I am now
              using my time to learn everything about{' '}
              <span className='text-[#00bfff]'>React</span> and styling with{' '}
              <span className='text-[#00bfff]'>Tailwind CSS</span>.{' '}
            </p>

              In my experience being a front-end developer, I have loved all the
              technologies that I am using and how it's evolving my creativity
              and making me more efficient overall and unlocking my designing
              potential. I am now mastering my craft in front-end development by
              learning <span className='text-[#00bfff]'>Next.js</span> and other
              tools that will speed up the production of design. I definitely am
              loving the process of Web Development and it really helps me to
              appreciate the product that I create in the end.
